## Bugs and Fixes

**Bug:** *The smoothie app had no signup view.*

**Cause:** *The signup view was referenced in smoothies/urls.py, but did not exist in smoothies/views.py. Django could not find the function, so the app failed to load.*

**Solution:** *Add signup view to smoothies/views.py using Django's built in UserCreationForm.*

**Result:** *The signup page and form are now visible (yet to be functional.)*
